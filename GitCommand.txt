A Simple GitCommand.txt 

What should be the steps in which we should do in order to push code to git.
[Commands]
1. git add TODO.txt >> 
2. git commit TODO.txt -m "Test Commit"
3. git push -u origin master

When you change a file which is already in the repo, you have to "git add" it again if you want it to be staged.

This allows you to commit only a subset of changes you made since the last commit. For example let's say you have file a, file b and file c.
You modify file a and file b but the changes are very different in nature and you dont want all of them to be in one single commit. You issue
"git add a
git commit a -m "bugfix, in a"
git add b
git commit b -m "new feature, in b" "

As a side note, if you want to commit everything you can just type 
"git commit -a "

Understanding Branches

Q - Why should we create branches?
